# Canonical pre-commit configuration for the Qwen3-VL project
# This configuration includes code formatting, linting, type checking, and other quality checks
#
# Configuration Variants:
# - Full Configuration (this file): Complete set of hooks for comprehensive code quality
# - Recommended Configuration: Minimal set of essential hooks for faster CI/CD
#   (see .pre-commit-config-recommended.yaml for reference)
# - Enhanced Configuration: Additional hooks beyond basic but less than full
#   (see .pre-commit-config-enhanced.yaml for historical reference)
#
# To install: pre-commit install
# To run manually: pre-commit run --all-files
# To update hooks: pre-commit autoupdate
