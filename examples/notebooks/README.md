# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for the Qwen3-VL multimodal model optimization project.

## Purpose

Jupyter notebooks in this directory serve various purposes:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Experimentation with datasets and visualization of data characteristics
- **Model Prototyping**: Quick iterations on model architectures and hyperparameters
- **Interactive Testing**: Hands-on testing of model components and features
- **Visualization**: Creating plots and charts to understand model behavior and performance
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for using different aspects of the Qwen3-VL model
- **Experiment Documentation**: Recording experimental setups, results, and observations

## Naming Convention

Notebooks should follow a consistent naming convention:

```
[level]_[topic]_[optional_subtopic].ipynb
```

Examples:
- `basic_usage_overview.ipynb` - Basic usage examples
- `intermediate_model_finetuning.ipynb` - More complex fine-tuning examples
- `advanced_kv_cache_optimization.ipynb` - Advanced optimization techniques
- `tutorial_tensor_parallelism.ipynb` - Tutorial on tensor parallelism

## Guidelines

- Keep notebooks focused on a single topic or concept
- Include sufficient documentation and comments
- Use markdown cells to explain concepts and methodologies
- Clean up cell outputs before committing (Kernel -> Restart & Clear Output)
- Use relative paths when referencing project files
- Avoid storing large datasets directly in notebooks
